# SEED-Labs-Packet-Sniffing-and-Spoofing-Lab

[For more details check out my article at my website](https://dorazaria.github.io/network/packet-sniffing-and-spoofing-lab/) <br>

Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security; they are two major threats in network communication. <br>
Being able to understand these two threats is essential for understanding security measures in networking.<br><br>
There are many packet sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark, Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, etc. <br>
Some of these tools are widely used by security experts, as well as by attackers.<br>
Being able to use these tools is important for students, but what is more important for students in a network security course is to understand how these tools work, 
i.e., how packet sniffing and spoofing are implemented in software.<br><br>
The objective of this lab is two-fold: learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies underlying these tools. 
For the second object, students will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, <br> and gain an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. <br><br>
This lab covers the following topics:
* How the sniffing and spoofing work
* Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy
* Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy
* Manipulating packets using Scapy
